### How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
- be creative, descriptive about context of the word, like how it's created and which parts of the word mean what.
- use web search to show images of the word usage
- help with pronunciation.

Other LLMs like [Perplexity](www.perplexity.ai) and [Phind](https://www.phind.com/) do it automatically and include search results with images
